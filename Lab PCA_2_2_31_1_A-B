# Objectives
# 
# Familiarize the student with:
# 
#     using the while loop;
#     finding the proper implementation of verbally defined rules;
#     reflecting real-life situations in computer code.
# 
# Scenario
# 
# Listen to our story: a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with wooden blocks. They are building a pyramid. Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall - it's flat. The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle: each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.
# 
# The figure illustrates the rule used by the builders.
# 
# Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.
# 
# Note: the height is measured by the number of fully completed layers - if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately.
# 
# Test your code using the data we've provided.
# 
# Example input

# Example output
# Height of the pyramid: 3
